/**
 * A clock that gets its time over the network from a ClockServer.
 * This class will throw a ClockException if there are problems communicating
 * with the ClockServer.
 *
 * To get the time, the clock sends a timestamped packet to to the server.
 * The server responds with its current time.  The client then timestamps
 * the response.  The client can then calculate an estimated offset between
 * the two clocks as well as an error bound on this calculation.
 *
 * Because of this, getPhase() should really be used on a ClockClient.
 * However, getValue() can be used.  getValue() calculates the current time
 * by using the HighFrequencyClock as a timekeeper.
 *
 * Calls to ClientClock may take some time since a server response
 * is required.
